Habitat of Humanity of Pulaski County, KY Affiliate Website
================

A project in which I designed & developed a website for Habitat of Humanity of Pulaski County, KY.

From planning to implementation, the project lasted from December 2011 to March 2012.

This was a pro bono side project that invovled creating a brand new website for their affiliate branch.   
The goal was simply to develop a place for them to host their content and allow users to apply for assistance.  
This would ultimately enable them to attract new volunteers, receive online donations, share events, and so on.  

The design, development, and content were all put together by myself (with some guidance from their staff).  
It was built using HTML5, jQuery, PHP, and Twitter Bootstrap (v2.0).  
By utilizing Bootstrap as the underlying technology, the website scales properly to work on any device from a smartphone to a widescreen monitor.  
This allowed me to utilize a "write once, works everywhere" approach for the website design, which I feel was ultimately a success.
