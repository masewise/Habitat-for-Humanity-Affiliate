						<h2>Welcome</h2>
						<p>
							Welcome to the new online home of Habitat for Humanity of Pulaski County, Kentucky!  We are working to build simple, decent, affordable housing and ultimately improve the quality
							our community as a whole.  Join us in this exciting mission by <a href="donate.html">making a financial contribution</a>, <a href="volunteer.html">volunteering your time</a>, 
							or by <a href="apply.html">applying for assistance</a> today. With your help, we can make a difference!
						</p>
						
						<hr/>
						
						<h2>Run Home for Habitat 5K!</h2>
						<p>
							Ready to run for a good cause and get in shape in the process?  We thought so!  We are very excited to announce that the <a href="events.html">Run Home for Habitat 5K</a> is now open for registration.  
							Additional details and	a downloadable registration form are available on our <a href="events.html">Events</a> page.  We look forward to seeing you on race day!
						</p>
						
						<hr/>
						
						<h2>The Genesis House</h2>
						<p>							
							The Genesis House is the current name of our first house.  We anticipate building the home in the Summer of 2012.  We will need a total of $55,000 to complete this home.  Due to our fundraising
							efforts, we now have $21,000 in the bank, which means we are in need of $34,000 more.  We would love to be able to add your name to our donor list!  We plan on building the house so it is 
							energy efficient and "green".  It will have 3 to 4 bedrooms depending on the size of the selected family.  The family will have a mortgage on the house and provide "sweat equity" in order to build 
							it.  Volunteers are used to reduce the cost of the house to make it more affordable to the selected family.  
						</p>
						<p>
							We would like to welcome you go join us in making the Genesis House a reality!  There are currently several volunteer opportunities available.  We need your help on the resource development 
							committee as we continue to raise money for the first build.  You could also join the family selection committee and assist us in our selection of a family with whom to partner.  We can always 
							use a hand in the construction of the new home as well.  You do not have to have experience in any of these fields to work with Habitat!  Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for 
							additional information regarding these opportunities!
						</p>
						
						<hr/>
						
						<h2>Looking for Help</h2>
						<p>
							We are looking for churches to help us with finding volunteers, fund raising, and finding families interested in one of our houses. We would be happy to have someone visit your church 
							and talk about how we can make a difference right here in Pulaski County.  Just let us know what time works for your group and we can have someone come visit with you.  Please give us a 
							<a href="contact.html">call or send an email</a> at your convenience.
